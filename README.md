<h1>Python labs:</h1>
<ul>
  <li><h3>DoublingInput:</h3> </br> The following code reads in an integer from input and outputs the number with 5 added to it.</br>
Input consists of a single integer N.</br>
Output 2N</li>
  <li><h3>DifferenceBetweenTwoNumbers:</h3></br>The following program reads from input two real numbers and outputs their difference.</br>
Input consists of two real-valued numbers x and y, each on their own line.</br>
Output x − y.
 </li>
  <li><h3>Variance,Mean,StandardDeviation:</h3> </br> The following program computes and displays the mean, variance and standard deviation of four real numbers entered by a user. 
</br>To compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of numbers a, b, c, d entered by a user, use the following three equations:<ul>
<li> 1. mean =(a + b + c + d)/4</li>
<li> 2. variance =((mean − a)^2 + (mean − b)^2 + (mean − c)^2 + (mean − d)^2)/4 </li>
<li> 3. standard deviation =√var </li>
</ul>
</br>
Input consists of four real-valued numbers a, b, c, d, each on their own line.
Output the mean, variance and standard deviation of the numbers, each on a new line. 
</li>
<li><h3>MinimumBetweenThreeNumbers:</h3> </br> The following program for finding and displaying the minimum of three real-valued numbers entered
by a user. The following pseudocode was used for this program:</br> </br>
input x </br>
input y </br>
input z </br>
if x <= y </br>
  minimum = x </br>
else </br>
  minimum = y </br>
if z < minimum: </br>
  minimum = z </br>
display minimum </br>
   </br>
Input consists of a three real-valued numbers (of type float), each on a new line. </br>
Output the smallest of the three numbers.
</li>
<li><h3>GradeCodeAccordingtoGradeScore:</h3> </br>The following program accepts an integer in the range [0, 100] and outputs the corresponding
grade. Using the following list below to match the mark with the correct grade.</br>
<h4>Grade Mark</h4><ul>
<li>1.First 75+</li>
<li>2.Upper second 70 − 74</li>
<li>3.Lower second 60 − 69</li>
<li>4.Third 50 − 59</li>
<li>5.Fail < 50</li>
</ul>
</br>
Input consists of a single integer specifying the mark.
Output the corresponding grade.
